Objective-C SQL Query Builder

This repository contains two sets of Objective-C based classes that handle a SQLite database.  The DAO folder contains
a class that easily manages the database connection.  The SQL folder contains a collection of SQL builder classes that
can be used to construct well-formed SQL statements for SQLite via a plethora of convenience methods similar to those
found in LINQ.  Each method essentially mimics its SQL equivalent; so, there is almost no learning curve.

All classes were designed to be used in iPhone/iOS applications.

These classes are well-documented.  Unlike other SQLite libraries written in Objective-C, these classes are very cleanly
written and utilize clear naming conventions.  In addition, this repository's Wiki has a number of examples.  If you find
any bugs or have any suggestions on how these classes can be improved, please drop me a line.
